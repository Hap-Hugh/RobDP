 * approx_tuple_count

 *
 * We intentionally compute the selectivity under JOIN_INNER rules, even
 * if it's some type of outer join.  This is appropriate because we are
 * trying to figure out how many tuples pass the initial merge or hash
 * join step.
 *
 * This is quick-and-dirty because we bypass clauselist_selectivity, and
 * simply multiply the independent clause selectivities together.  Now
 * clauselist_selectivity often can't do any better than that anyhow, but
 * for some situations (such as range constraints) it is smarter.  However,
 * we can't effectively cache the results of clauselist_selectivity, whereas
 * the individual clause selectivities can be and are cached.

 * Since we are only using the results to estimate how many potential
 * output tuples are generated and passed through qpqual checking, it
 * seems OK to live with the approximation.
