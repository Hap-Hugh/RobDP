/*
 * select_path_by_retention_set
 *
 * From the given candidate list, keep at most `select_path_limit` Paths
 * using multiple scoring strategies and a round-robin selection policy.
 * Winners are appended to `*kept_list_ptr` (which may already contain entries),
 * and the function returns a List* of all pruned (not kept) Paths.
 *
 * Contract (per-strategy):
 *   - Lower score = better.
 *   - Each strategy function must:
 *       * Fill rank_arr[0..cand_count-1] with {path, score} for each node in
 *         `cand_list`, in the same iteration order.
 *       * Assign DBL_MAX (or equivalent) to paths with zero effective samples.
 *   - `min_envelope` and `sample_count` should already be prepared (e.g., clamped
 *     to available dimensions) by the caller.
 *
 * Multi-strategy policy:
 *   - We build four PathRank arrays:
 *       1) calc_worst_penalty()
 *       2) calc_expected_penalty()
 *       3) calc_expected_total_cost()
 *       4) calc_expected_penalty_with_std()
 *   - Selection is done in round-robin order over these four strategies:
 *       strategy 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> ...
 *   - For each strategy in turn, we pick the *best* (lowest score) path
 *     not yet selected according to that strategy. Selected paths are
 *     never picked again by later strategies.
 *   - The process stops when either:
 *       * We have selected `select_path_limit` paths, or
 *       * A full round over all strategies fails to select any new path
 *         (e.g., all remaining have DBL_MAX scores).
 *
 * Score exposure:
 *   - If `should_save_score` is true, we store the score from
 *     calc_expected_total_cost() into Path->score for both kept and dropped
 *     paths. This gives a single consistent scalar per Path, even though
 *     the selection itself is multi-strategy and round-robin.
 *
 * Return:
 *   - List* of pruned Paths (those NOT kept). If nothing is pruned, returns NIL.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - Winners are NOT sorted here; order is deterministic but not guaranteed to
 *     be strictly increasing by score. If a sorted order is required, the caller
 *     should sort `*kept_list_ptr` afterward.
 *   - Existing entries in `*kept_list_ptr` are preserved; winners are appended.
 *   - This function does NOT free list cells of `cand_list` (parameter is const).
 *     If the caller needs to release list cells of `cand_list`, do it outside
 *     after the call.

/*
 * set_path_score
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Compute a score for every Path in `cand_list` using the provided strategy
 *   function, and store the result into `path->score`.
 *
 * What this function DOES:
 *   - Allocates a temporary PathRank array sized to `cand_count`.
 *   - Invokes `path_strategy_func(cand_list, rank_arr, min_envelope, sample_count)`.
 *     The strategy fills rank_arr[0..cand_count-1] with (path, score) pairs
 *     that correspond to the iteration order of `cand_list`.
 *   - Writes `rank_arr[i].score` back into the associated `Path` via `path->score`.
 *   - Frees the temporary array and returns.
 *
 * What this function DOES NOT do:
 *   - It does NOT select or prune candidates.
 *   - It does NOT sort winners or losers.
 *   - It does NOT modify list topology (no cells are freed or appended).
 *
 * Contract & Assumptions:
 *   - Lower score means better.
 *   - The strategy must assign a finite score for valid candidates and should
 *     assign DBL_MAX (or equivalent “worst”) to paths with zero effective samples.
 *   - `min_envelope` and `sample_count` have already been prepared/clamped by caller.
 *   - `sample_count >= 1` and `sample_count <= DIST_MAX_SAMPLE`.
 *
 * External invariants (referenced but not changed here):
 *   - `kept_list_ptr` and `select_path_limit` are asserted for sanity only.
 *     They are not read for control-flow in this routine and are presumed
 *     to be defined in the surrounding module.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   - cand_list:     list of Path* to be scored.
 *   - min_envelope:  baseline (per-sample) array needed by the scoring strategy.
 *   - path_strategy_func: callback that computes path scores.
 *   - sample_count:  number of samples the strategy should consider.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *   - Each Path in cand_list receives its computed score in `Path->score`.
 *
 * Return:
 *   - void
 *
 * Error handling:
 *   - Early return if cand_list is empty.
 *   - Asserts enforce basic preconditions in assertions-enabled builds.

 * - Sample storage uses an embedded fixed-size array inside `Sample`
 *   (e.g., double sample[DIST_MAX_SAMPLE];), so no extra allocation is needed

 * - List orders match across rounds so `forboth` walks 1:1; if lengths differ,
 *   `forboth` stops at the shorter list.
 * - This routine records the per-round scalar value:
 *        Min(cur_rel->min_score, cur_rel->partial_min_score)
 *   into the sample slot for `round`. Any later elementwise-min over rounds
 *   (i.e., a true "minimum envelope") is expected to be performed elsewhere.
